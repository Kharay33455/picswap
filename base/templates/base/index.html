        <h2>Quick guide to using Art Swap to buy and sell photos.</h2>
        <p>
            Firstly, let's make it clear that we exclusively handle images licensed by us. Images copyrighted by other
            entities cannot be traded on this platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can copyright your original image through us for a one time payment fee $50 per image, obtaining a
            license that permits you to distribute the image and protects it from unauthorized use. This covers banners,
            Facebook and other social media posts, blog posts, store decorations, and similar uses. </p>
        <p>
            If you sell a licensed image to a buyer, all rights are transferred to them. This enables them to use and
            modify the image as they wish. Additionally, you are not allowed to redistribute the image or create new
            copies of it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Buying images on Art Swap
        </h3>
        <p>
            When purchasing an image copyrighted by us, our escrow service ensures a smooth transaction between buyer
            and seller. Initially, the image is held by us. The buyer deposits the agreed amount into their wallet and
            transfers it to the escrow account. Upon confirmation from the seller that the amount matches the agreed
            order, the funds are released to the seller and the image is transferred to the buyer. A licensing fee,
            based on a percentage of the transaction amount, is required to receive your license.</p>
        <h4>
            Selling images on Art Swap
        </h4>
        <p>
            Selling an image on Art Swap is straightforward. Begin by uploading the original copy of your image in any
            format. Next, ensure the image is copyrighted in your catalog, which incurs a one-time fee of $50. We verify
            its originality and absence of copyright infringement with other agencies. Note that you are responsible for
            uploading only your own content. Once completed, you can list the image for sale. A unique token code
            specific to your image will be generated. Share this code with your buyer or initiate an order to start the
            transaction. Avoid sending the image directly to the buyer as we cannot provide protection if you do so.
